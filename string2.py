# Instructions:
# Complete each of these string exercises in the same way as the
# previous String1 excercises.

# D. verbing
# Given a string, if its length is at least 3, add 'ing' to its
# end unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case add 'ly'
# instead.
# If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
# Return the resulting string.


def verbing(s):
    length = len(s)
    if length>2:
        if s[-3:] =='ing':
            s+= 'ly'
        else:
            s+= 'ing'
    return s


# E. not_bad
# Given a string, find the first occurrence of the substrings
# 'not' and 'bad'. If the 'bad' follows the 'not', replace
# the whole 'not'...'bad' substring with 'good'.
# Return the resulting string.
# Example:
#   'This dinner is not that bad!' -> 'This dinner is good!'


def not_bad(s):
    snb = s.find('not')
    sgood = s.find('bad')
    if sgood > snb:
        s= s.replace(s[snb:(sgood+3)], 'good')
        return s
    else:
        return s


# F. front_back
# Consider dividing a string into two halves.
# If the length is even, the front and back halves are the same
# length. If the length is odd, we'll say that the extra
# character goes in the front half.
#   e.g. 'abcde', the front half is 'abc', the back half 'de'.
# Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form:
#   a-front + b-front + a-back + b-back


def front_back(a, b):
    length1 = len(a)
    length2 = len(b)
    if length1 % 2 == 0:
        index1 = length1 // 2
    else:
        index1 = (length1 // 2) +1

    if length2 % 2 == 0:
        index2 = length2 // 2
    else:
        index2 = (length2 // 2) +1
    front1 = a[0:index1]
    back1 = a[index1:]
    front2 = b[0:index2]
    back2 = b[index2:] 
    return front1 + front2 + back1 + back2

# inputs, using test() to check whether each result is correct or not.

    # Each line calls one of the functions above and compares its
    # result to the expected return value for that call.
